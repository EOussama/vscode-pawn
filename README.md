# vscode-pawn README

Pawn tools for vscode powered by sampctl.

Currently this is a port of the Sublime Text package syntax highlighting with some extra commands for compiling Pawn code with sampctl.

Coming soon:

* Static Analysis
* Auto-complete
* Intellisense support

## Features

Currently just syntax highlighting.

Once the [Pawn-Parser](https://github.com/Southclaws/pawn-parser) project reaches a workable state, this extension will feature more language features such as intellisense support, go-to-definition, view-all-references, etc...

## Requirements

* sampctl
  * [The essential Pawn for SA:MP development tool!](http://sampctl.com)

## Extension Settings

(None yet)
